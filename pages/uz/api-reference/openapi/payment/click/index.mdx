description: Click payment initiation and fiscalization APIs
---

## Overview

The **Click API** provides a complete workflow for processing Click payments,
starting from payment initiation to fiscalization and receipt generation.

The integration is split into two logical stages:

1. **Click Pass** – initiates a payment request using a QR code and amount.
2. **Fiscalization** – confirms the completed payment and registers it with the tax system.

This separation ensures flexibility, reliability, and compliance with fiscal regulations.

## Payment Flow

The typical Click payment flow looks like this:

1. The client initiates a payment using **Click Pass API**
2. Click processes the payment and returns a `payment_id`
3. After successful payment, the transaction is **fiscalized**
4. A fiscal receipt is generated and registered in the Soliq system

Each step has its own endpoint and responsibility.
