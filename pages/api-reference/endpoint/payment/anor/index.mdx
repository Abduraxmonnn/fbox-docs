## Overview

The **Anor API** provides a full payment processing workflow using Anor,
covering both **payment initiation** and **fiscalization**.

The integration is divided into two independent stages:

1. **Anor Payment** – initiates a Anor payment using an amount and QR code.
2. **Fiscalization** – confirms the completed payment and registers it with the fiscal system.

This approach ensures reliable payment processing and compliance with fiscal regulations.

## General Setup

All Anor endpoints share these common settings:

- **Status code:** `200`/`400`/`500`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Auth required:** `No`
- **Content-Type:** `application/json`

> **Note:** Even in case of validation, payment, or fiscalization errors, the API returns HTTP `200`.

- Always check `is_success` and `HTTP status code` to determine if the request succeeded.
- `data` contains the payload on success; `error` contains details on failure.

## Anor Flow

A typical Anor payment flow consists of the following steps:

1. The client initiates a payment via the **Anor Payment API**
2. Anor processes the payment and returns a unique `payment_id`
3. After successful payment, the transaction is sent for **fiscalization**
4. A fiscal receipt is generated and registered in the Soliq system

Each step is handled by a dedicated endpoint.
