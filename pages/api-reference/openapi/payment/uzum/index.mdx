## Overview

The **Uzum FastPay API** enables payment processing using Uzum’s FastPay system,
covering both **payment initiation** and **fiscalization**.

The integration is split into two independent stages:

1. **Uzum FastPay Payment** – initiates a payment using an amount and QR code.
2. **Fiscalization** – confirms the completed payment and registers it with the fiscal system.

This separation ensures reliable payment handling and compliance with fiscal regulations.

## General Setup

All Uzum FastPay endpoints share these common settings:

- **Status code:** `200`/`400`/`500`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Auth required:** `No`
- **Content-Type:** `application/json`

> **Note:** Even in case of validation, payment, or fiscalization errors, the API returns HTTP `200`.

- Always check `is_success` and `HTTP status code` to determine if the request succeeded.
- `data` contains the payload on success; `error` contains details on failure.

## Payment Flow

A typical Uzum FastPay payment flow consists of the following steps:

1. The client initiates a payment via the **Uzum FastPay Payment API**
2. Uzum processes the transaction and returns a unique `payment_id`
3. After successful payment, the transaction is sent for **fiscalization**
4. A fiscal receipt is generated and registered in the Soliq system

Each step is handled by a dedicated endpoint.
