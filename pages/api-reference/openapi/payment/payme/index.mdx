description: PayMe payment initiation and fiscalization APIs

## Overview

The **PayMe API** provides a full payment processing workflow using PayMe,
covering both **payment initiation** and **fiscalization**.

The integration is divided into two independent stages:

1. **PayMe Go** – initiates a PayMe payment using an amount and QR code.
2. **Fiscalization** – confirms the completed payment and registers it with the fiscal system.

This approach ensures reliable payment processing and compliance with fiscal regulations.

## Payment Flow

A typical PayMe payment flow consists of the following steps:

1. The client initiates a payment via the **PayMe Go API**
2. PayMe processes the payment and returns a unique `payment_id`
3. After successful payment, the transaction is sent for **fiscalization**
4. A fiscal receipt is generated and registered in the Soliq system

Each step is handled by a dedicated endpoint.
